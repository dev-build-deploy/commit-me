# CommitMe

CommitMe provides [multiple tools](#tooling) for validating commit messages against [Conventional Commits].

## Tooling

There are two main options available:

* A CLI tool for managing your local (git) repository
* A GitHub Action to validate your Pull Request/Repository contents

### Command Line Interface

The CLI tool can be used for local operations around your git repository, validating the commits in your current branch against the main branch (`main`).

> **NOTE** Option to specifiy the baseline branch will be added later

#### Example usage

Running the `check` command...
```
$ commit-me check
```

...will result in output similar to:

![Example](./docs/images/cli_example.png)

> **NOTE**: highlighting and colors are applied in case your shell support this.

### GitHub Action

The GitHub Action will validate all commits as part of your current Pull Request.

### Example usage

```yaml
name: Conventional Commits
on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  pull-request: read

jobs:
  commit-me:
    name: Conventional Commit compliance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dev-build-deploy/commit-me@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ github.token }}
```

This will result in output similar to:

![Example](./docs/images/action-example.png)

In addition, annotations are added to files containing a non-compliance issue.
